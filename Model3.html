<p>If you are a fan of Marvel’s Iron Man in reel-life, you have to know about Elon Musk, the real-life Iron Man. While it’s not appropriate to draw parallels between an imaginary comic character and a real-life human, you just can’t ignore the similarities between the two. Both of them have worked towards the advancement of science and keep on bringing new technologies, which are much ahead of their time.

Musk is currently at the helm of three companies that include Paypal, Tesla Inc. (formerly known as Tesla Motors), and SpaceX. We are more interested towards the Tesla Inc., a company that pioneers in manufacturing all-electric luxury cars. Today, Tesla Inc. is valued more than some of the biggest names in the automotive industry and that’s not bad at all, given that Tesla Motors is just over a decade old</p>
